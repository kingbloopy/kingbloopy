I am a software developer with a passion for React, Redux, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS and Ruby on Rails. Whether it is design, graphic art, photography, making music or programming a new application, I have a creative side that I have always enjoyed exploring and growing. 

I love learning about new technologies and challenging myself to think logically, methodically, and creatively. When building an idea, a userâ€™s experience is very important to me, so I strive to craft an interface that is innovative, visually appealing, and intuitive for everyone.

Currently, I am learning TypeScript, Next.js and Vue.js. I strive to find time to learn more!
