I am an experienced producer with a strong foundation in leading teams and collaborating with cross-functional groups to execute complex product development cycles. My expertise spans digital strategy, project management, product ownership, UI/web design, e-commerce, operations, client success, and software engineering. Iâ€™ve thrived in dynamic, multi-faceted roles, allowing me to wear many hats and contribute effectively to both the strategic and technical aspects of projects. With a focus on clear communication, collaboration, and decision-making, I am skilled in balancing multiple projects simultaneously while maintaining strong client relationships and delivering results in fast-paced environments.

Outside of work, you can find me embracing the outdoors. Whether itâ€™s mountain biking, snowboarding, climbing, hiking, trail running, camping, or river rafting. Iâ€™m passionate about living life to the fullest and bringing that same energy and focus to my professional endeavors.
