I am a Frontend Software Developer with professional experience working closely with React, Redux, Javascript, Shopifyâ€™s liquid templating language, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, SASS and Ruby on Rails. Whether it is a large e-commerce website for a client, design, graphic art, photography, making music or programming a new application, I have a creative side that I have always enjoyed exploring and growing. I love learning about new technologies and challenging myself to think logically, methodically, and creatively. When building an idea, a userâ€™s experience is very important to me, so I strive to craft an interface that is innovative, visually appealing, and intuitive for everyone.

Currently, I am developing another e-commerce project using a FireBase backend, and React/Next.js/TypeScript frontend. I always strive to learn more!
